# Endless Runner - Aims

Todayâ€™s game demo will consist of creating an endless runner style game.  This game will be a vertical scroller where the player must stay on the screen and move between platforms. The demo will cover

- Creating scrolling backgrounds
- Placing beams at evenly spaced intervals
- Using the solid behaviour to create platforms
- Using the platform movement behaviour to control the player

# Endless Runner - Guide

A step by step accompanying guide can be found on Ultra for this game endless runner game. I will live demo these steps but you may wish to follow along with the guide as reference, or to refer back to later on.

The guide can be found under the Week 4 Materials.

# Extension Challenges

Extend your exploration and learning of Construct by enhancing the endless runner game. Here are some suggested adaptations you could make to the game:

- Allow the game to end and restart.
- Score - Add a score so the player gains points the longer they surview
- Obstacles - Vary the game play with obstacles on the beams (e.g. spikes)
- Collectibles - Add items for the player to collect
- Increase the difficulty as the game progresses
