# What is Game Prototyping?

![](../assets/icons/assessment.png#ico-right)

- **Purpose of Prototyping**
  - Game prototyping tests core concepts, mechanics, and user experience before full development begins

- **Types of Prototyping**
  - Prototypes include paper sketches, digital mockups, grey-box models, and slices to explore ideas effectively.

- **Benefits of Prototyping**
  - Iterative prototyping saves resources and enhances creativity by refining gameplay and identifying issues early.
  
<!--
Game prototyping is the process of creating simplified versions of a game to test its core concepts, mechanics, and user experience. These prototypes focus on functionality rather than aesthetics, allowing developers to explore ideas quickly and efficiently. There are various types of prototypes used in the industry, including paper prototypes, digital mockups, grey-box models, and vertical or horizontal slices. Each type serves a specific purpose, from sketching out initial ideas to demonstrating polished gameplay segments. 

Prototyping is essential because it enables developers to validate their concepts before committing significant resources to full-scale development. By experimenting with different mechanics and interactions, teams can identify potential issues early, refine gameplay elements, and ensure that the game is engaging and feasible. This iterative approach not only saves time and money but also fosters creativity and innovation within the development process.

# Why Prototype

![](../assets/icons/assessment.png#ico-right)

- **Early Idea Validation**
  - Prototyping helps developers quickly validate game ideas to ensure gameplay is enjoyable and feasible early on.
- **Risk Reduction**
  - Identifying design flaws and technical issues early reduces risk and avoids costly mistakes later in development.
- **Improved Communication**
  - Prototyping provides a tangible model that enhances team and stakeholder communication about the game vision.
- **Enhanced Gameplay Refinement**
  - Iterative prototyping allows refinement of mechanics, controls, and pacing for a polished, engaging game experience.

<!--
Prototyping is a critical step in game development for several reasons. Firstly, it allows developers to validate their ideas early in the process, ensuring that the core gameplay is enjoyable and feasible. This early validation helps avoid investing time and resources into concepts that may not work. 

Secondly, prototyping reduces risk by identifying design flaws and technical issues before they escalate. 

It also improves communication among team members and stakeholders by providing a tangible model of the game’s vision. Additionally, prototyping enhances gameplay by allowing designers to test and refine mechanics, controls, and pacing. This iterative process leads to a more polished and engaging final product. 

In web-based game development, prototyping is especially beneficial due to the fast iteration cycles and ease of deployment, making it ideal for rapid feedback and agile development.

# Stages of Prototyping

![](../assets/icons/assessment.png#ico-right)

- **Concept Design**
  - Developers outline the game’s core idea and objectives to establish a clear vision for the project.
- **Paper Prototype**
  - A simple, hand-drawn prototype is created to map out mechanics and game flow using basic materials.
- **Digital Prototype**
  - An interactive digital version is built to test gameplay elements and user experience early on.
- **Playtesting and Iteration**
  - Feedback is gathered through playtesting to refine mechanics and improve the gameplay experience.

<!--
The prototyping process in game development typically follows several key stages. It begins with concept design, where developers define the game’s core idea and objectives (this is what you've done with your first assessments). 

Next is the creation of a paper prototype, which involves sketching out mechanics and flow using simple materials. This is followed by building a digital prototype, a basic interactive version that tests gameplay elements. 

Playtesting is then conducted to gather feedback and observe user interactions. Based on this feedback, developers iterate on the prototype, refining mechanics and addressing issues. 

Finally, a pitch prototype is created to showcase a polished slice of the game to stakeholders or potential investors. Each stage builds upon the previous one, allowing for continuous improvement and validation of the game’s design. This structured approach ensures that the game evolves in a thoughtful and efficient manner, reducing risks and enhancing overall quality.

These are the stages you will follow between now and your final assessment submissions

# Pitfalls & Best Practice

![](../assets/icons/assessment.png#ico-right)

- **Avoid Over-Polishing Early**
  - Over-polishing prototypes too soon distracts from testing core mechanics and delays valuable feedback.
- **Importance of Feedback and Playtesting**
  - Ignoring feedback and skipping playtesting hinders issue identification and improvement opportunities.
- **Embrace Flexibility and Iteration**
  - Being open to changes and pivoting based on insights enhances creativity and leads to better game outcomes.
- **Keep Prototypes Simple and Focused**
  - Prototyping early and often with simple designs ensures focus on core gameplay mechanics.

<!--
While prototyping is essential, developers must be aware of common pitfalls to avoid. One major mistake is over-polishing the prototype too early, which can divert focus from testing core mechanics. 

Ignoring feedback and skipping playtesting are also detrimental, as they prevent the identification of issues and hinder improvement. 

Rigid adherence to initial ideas can stifle creativity and limit the potential for innovation. To ensure effective prototyping, developers should prototype early and often, keeping designs simple and focused on core gameplay. Feedback loops are crucial for refining mechanics and enhancing user experience. 

Flexibility is key—being open to changes and willing to pivot based on insights leads to better outcomes. By following these best practices, developers can maximise the benefits of prototyping and create games that are both fun and functional.

# 2. Peer Feedback

# Rapid Feedback Circles

![](../assets/icons/conversation.png#ico-right)

In your groups, each member will present their prototype idea and receive initial feedback. You’ll have **5 minutes** per person.

- **2 min:** Pitch your game concept (core idea, intended experience, key mechanics)
- **3 mins:** Peer feedback and questions
  - When giving feedback consider:
    - *"I like..."* (what excites or intrigues you about the concept)
    - *"I wonder..."* (what's unclear or needs more explanation)
    - *"What if..."* (suggestions for features, mechanics or improvements)

<!--
Let's start the process of gathering feedback on game concepts with some rapid feedback circles...

When giving feedback focus on....

Be constructive, not critical.
Focus on clarity, engagement, and feasibility.
Ask questions that help the presenter think deeper about their design.

Make sure you take notes when collecting feedback on your idea. This can be documented in your final project submissions.

<!-- _class: small-txt -->

# Rapid Prototyping

![](../assets/icons/tools.png#ico-right)

Create a testable prototype that explores a key question about your game concept—such as player engagement, clarity of mechanics, or usability.

- **Choose a Format:** Decide whether to build a paper prototype or a digital mockup.
- **Focus on the Core Loop:** Your prototype should demonstrate the main player action or interaction cycle.
- **Design for Testing:** Ensure another student can playtest your prototype in 5–10 minutes.
- **Define Your Question:** What are you trying to learn from this prototype? Examples:
  - "Is this mechanic intuitive?"
  - "Does this loop feel rewarding?"
  - "Can players understand the goal?"

<!--
Over the next 90 minutes you should build a testable prototype for your game concept. You should focus on a specific element of your game that you want feedback on, therefore consider a question you are seeking to answer with the prototype.

Your prototype can either be on paper or a digital mockup. In either case focus on speed and do not worry about the fidelity of the experience (e.g. greyboxes are fine)

By the end of the activity aim to have something that you can test with someone else
